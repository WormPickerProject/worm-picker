## Overview

The `worm_picker_description` package contains the robot and workcell description files for the Worm Picker Robot system configured with a Motoman GP4 robot arm. It provides Unified Robot Description Format (URDF) and Xacro files, as well as meshes required for simulation and visualization in ROS 2 environments.

This package is essential for anyone working with the Worm Picker Robot, as it defines the physical properties, kinematics, and visual representations of both the robot and its workspace.
